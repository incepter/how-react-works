# How completeWork works

A few sections back, we rendered our application using React. This process
was very similar to the following code:

```tsx
// simplified
function workLoopSync() {
  // Perform work without checking if we need to yield between fiber.
  while (workInProgress !== null) {
    performUnitOfWork(workInProgress);
  }
}

function performUnitOfWork(unitOfWork: Fiber): void {
  const current = unitOfWork.alternate;

  // highlight-next-line
  const next = beginWork(current, unitOfWork, renderLanes);
  
  unitOfWork.memoizedProps = unitOfWork.pendingProps;
  if (next === null) {
    // If this doesn't spawn new work, complete the current work.
    // highlight-next-line
    completeUnitOfWork(unitOfWork);
  } else {
    workInProgress = next;
  }
}

```

Like we mentioned in an earlier section, React work loop will render a single
path from the `fiberRoot` passing direct first child by direct first child until
it reaches the very bottom.

In this case, `beginWork` will return a `null` fiber, which means there is no
more work to do in the current tree.

That's the role of the `completeUnitOfWork` function: it will infer the next
component to render.

We will see in details how the next fiber is chosen.

## Signature
```tsx
function completeUnitOfWork(unitOfWork: Fiber): void {
  
}
```

`completeUnitOfWork` is called with the `workInProgress` variable that refers
to the completed work of a component.

## Implementation

The goal of this function is to decide the next fiber to work on.

Here is a simplified version of it:
```tsx
// simplified
let completeWork = unitOfWork;

do {
  const current = completeWork.alternate;
  const returnFiber = completedWork.return;
  // complete work is a huge function that contains the real implementation
  // we will see it in a few.
  // highlight-next-line
  const next = completeWork(current, completeWork, renderLanes);
  
  // complete work decided that there is still some work to do
  if (next !== null) {
    // highlight-next-line
    workInProgress = next;
    return;
  }

  // if there is no next, take the sibling
  const siblingFiber = completeWork.sibling;
  if (siblingFiber !== null) {
    // highlight-next-line
    workInProgress = siblingFiber;
    return;
  }
  
  // otherwise, take the returnFiber of the completeWork
  completedWork = returnFiber;
  // highlight-next-line
  workInProgress = completedWork;
} while (completeWork !== null);
//...
```

So `completeUnitOfWork` will keep climbing back the tree while passing by
the siblings and so on.

On important thing to mention is that while passing to a `sibling`,
`performUnitOfWork` will pass through all its children until it reaches the
bottom again, then climb back using `completeUnitOfWork`.

But, `completeUnitOfWork` doesn't do all the work, it calls a huge function
of around 1000 lines of code ([`completeWork`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7f6201889e8e628eeb53e05d8850ddffa3c2e74a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCompleteWork.js#L927))
that we will see right now.

It is important to check this function for two reasons: The first is that it is
called from within `completeUnitOfWork` to decide the next fiber, and as fallback
when null is returned, it will look up on the sibling and parent.

## How `completeWork` works

`completeWork` is a huge function with a big [`switch statement`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7f6201889e8e628eeb53e05d8850ddffa3c2e74a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCompleteWork.js#L938).

### Signature

```tsx
function completeWork(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
): Fiber | null {
  switch (workInProgress.tag) {
    case IndeterminateComponent:
    case LazyComponent:
    case SimpleMemoComponent:
    case FunctionComponent:
    case ForwardRef:
    case Fragment:
    case Mode:
    case Profiler: 
    // .... other tags
    {
      
    }
  }
}
```

`completeWork` will perform the work based on the tag of the finished work.

### How completing `FunctionComponent` works

Function component is treated like any of these: `IndeterminateComponent`,
`LazyComponent`,`SimpleMemoComponent`,`FunctionComponent`,`ForwardRef`,
`Fragment`,`Mode`,`Profiler`,`ContextConsumer`,`MemoComponent`.

And it does the following:

```tsx
switch (workInProgress.tag) {
  case IndeterminateComponent:
  case LazyComponent:
  case SimpleMemoComponent:
  case FunctionComponent:
  case ForwardRef:
  case Fragment:
  case Mode:
  case Profiler:
  case ContextConsumer:
  case MemoComponent:
    bubbleProperties(workInProgress);
    return null;
    }
```

[`bubbleProperties`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7f6201889e8e628eeb53e05d8850ddffa3c2e74a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCompleteWork.js#L715)
is invoked on completed work, and it serves to merge the flags of the children
inside their parent (the complete work):


```tsx
// simplified
function bubbleProperties(completedWork: Fiber) {
  let subtreeFlags = NoFlags;
  let newChildLanes = NoLanes;
  let child = completedWork.child;
  
  while (child !== null) {
    newChildLanes = mergeLanes(
      newChildLanes,
      mergeLanes(child.lanes, child.childLanes),
    );

    subtreeFlags |= child.subtreeFlags;
    subtreeFlags |= child.flags;

    child.return = completedWork;
    child = child.sibling;
  }

  completedWork.subtreeFlags |= subtreeFlags;
  completedWork.childLanes = newChildLanes;
}
```

### How completing `ClassComponent` works
Finishing the work for `ClassComponent`s is similar to `FunctionComponent`
and the others since it will bubble the properties as well (this will be done
in almost all cases).


```tsx
switch (workInProgress.tag) {
  // ...
  case ClassComponent: {
    const Component = workInProgress.type;
    if (isLegacyContextProvider(Component)) {
      popLegacyContext(workInProgress);
    }
    // same as FunctionComponent
    bubbleProperties(workInProgress);
    return null;
  }
  // ...
}
```

ClassComponents have this special branching where they can be context providers
at the same time using the legacy `getChildContext()` API.

`getChildContext()` is marked as legacy and may not be active or bundled anymore.

### How completing `HostRoot` works

[Switch case](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/7f6201889e8e628eeb53e05d8850ddffa3c2e74a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCompleteWork.js#L959)
<TBD />


### How other tags work

## Recap

When all work is completed, and we rendered until reaching the very bottom of
each node of our tree, the `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot` will proceed then to
completing the render and committing the `root`.

Please take a look at the following code, we've already seen it, but it is
better that you refresh your memory to prepare for the next section.


```tsx
// simplified to only include relevant things
function performConcurrentWorkOnRoot(
  root: FiberRoot,
  didTimeout: boolean,
): RenderTaskFn | null {
  // previous code
  
  const exitStatus = shouldTimeSlice
    ? renderRootConcurrent(root, lanes) 
    : renderRootSync(root, lanes);
  
  if (exitStatus !== RootInProgress) {
    do {
      if (exitStatus === RootDidNotComplete) {
        markRootSuspended(root, lanes);
      } else {
        const finishedWork: Fiber = root.current.alternate;

        if (
          renderWasConcurrent &&
          !isRenderConsistentWithExternalStores(finishedWork)
        ) {
          exitStatus = renderRootSync(root, lanes);
          continue;
        }
        if (exitStatus === RootErrored) {
          // ...
        }
        if (exitStatus === RootFatalErrored) {
          // ...
          throw fatalError;
        }

        // highlight-next-line
        root.finishedWork = finishedWork;
        // highlight-next-line
        root.finishedLanes = lanes;
        // highlight-next-line
        finishConcurrentRender(root, exitStatus, finishedWork, lanes);
      }
      break;
    } while (true);
  }
}
```

The whole workLoop occurred inside `renderRootSync` or `renderRootConcurrent`
depending on your render lanes.

So after all work is done, the following code is what's important at this stage,
specifically the `finishConcurrentRender`.

```tsx
root.finishedWork = finishedWork;
root.finishedLanes = lanes;
// highlight-next-line
finishConcurrentRender(root, exitStatus, finishedWork, lanes);
```

Let's dive into finishing the render and the commit phase in the next section.
